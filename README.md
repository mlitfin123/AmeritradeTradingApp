# AmeritradeTradingApp

## Description:
This is a web application created using Python and Django to automated stock investing and trading. The application will require a TD Ameritrade account for live trading but it was set up to use Alpaca for paper trading and tracking live data. Since trading and investing is a long learning process I am constantly testing and updating the application to find the most ideal strategy for what I am working with. Currently the application uses the MACD and RSI for trading. I am currently planning on adding the EMA to adjust my strategy.

There is currently a very basic front-end created with Django to make running the scripts more simple, future plans include improving this front-end and adding the ability to manually add stocks and screeners.
